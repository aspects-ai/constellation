## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates

3. **Use the appropriate issue template** when creating new issues

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (Node.js version, OS, etc.)
- Minimal code example if applicable

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:
- Use the feature request template
- Explain the use case and benefit
- Consider implementation complexity
- Be open to discussion and alternatives

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/constellation-fs.git
   cd constellation-fs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following our style guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run quality checks**
   ```bash
   npm run lint        # Check code style
   npm run typecheck   # Verify TypeScript types
   npm test           # Run tests
   npm run build      # Ensure it builds
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature" # Use conventional commits
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types that might be useful to consumers

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Group related functionality in modules

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Aim for good test coverage

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` adding or updating tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add userId-based workspace management
fix: handle edge case in path resolution
docs: update README with new examples
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Backend Design

When adding new backends:
- Implement the `FileSystemBackend` interface
- Follow the existing pattern in `LocalBackend`
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include validation and security checks

### Safety First

ConstellationFS prioritizes security:
- Validate all user inputs
- Prevent directory traversal attacks
- Block dangerous operations by default
- Use workspace isolation

### Cross-Platform Support

- Test on different operating systems
- Use Node.js built-in modules when possible
- Handle path separators correctly
- Consider shell differences

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your PR**:
   - Has a clear title and description
   - Links to related issues
   - Includes tests for changes
   - Updates documentation if needed
   - Passes all CI checks

2. **PR Review Process**:
   - PRs require at least one review
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep discussions constructive
   - Be patient with the review process

3. **After Approval**:
   - PRs are squash-merged to main
   - Delete your feature branch after merge

## Documentation

### README Updates

When adding features, update the README:
- Add new examples
- Document configuration options
- Update API references
- Keep it concise and practical

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc for public APIs
- Include parameter and return type information
- Add usage examples for complex functions
- Document any gotchas or limitations

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create GitHub release
4. Publish to npm
